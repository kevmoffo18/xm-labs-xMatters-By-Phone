# How it works
- Calling a Twilio Voice enabled phone number will allow you to create a new xMatters event targeting a group of your choice.
- This integration initiate a Twilio function that will play a series of prompts to the caller. 
- The caller can press digits on their phone to control the xMatters event that is created.
- The user can record a message over the phone. The audio recording is transcribed and an mp3 audio file is stored on Twilio.  
- The URL to the audio recording is shortened using Bitly and both the transcription text and a shortened link to the recording is sent as part of the xMatters Notification.
- The caller ID of the calling phone must belong to a user inside of xMatters and must be configured in the Twilio function. Multiple users can initiate an event but they must be valid xMatters users.
- The Twilio functions will provide telephone prompts to guide you through initiate an xMatters notification.
- You can decide to send a regular xMatters Alert/Notification or an xMatters Conference Bridge.
- You can predefine up to 9 xMatters groups that can be target with your notification. You can select the group you would like to target using xMatters from phone prompts.
- The content of the message must be configured in the xMatters communication plan.

## Integration Function Workflow

1. User Calls Twilio Voice enabled phone number.


2. Twilio Function __xm_settings__ is initiated.
    - This file contains all the settings for the integration
    - Performs authentication based on the calling phone Caller ID.
    - Phones that block / hide the Caller ID will not be able to use this integrations.


3. Twilio Function  __xm_action__ is initiated.
    - Prompts the user to create a regular xMatters Alert or an Alert with a Conference Bridge. 
    - This sets a variable so _xm_message_ will send the event to the proper xMatters Inbound Integration URL.
    - 1. __Alert__ -> __On-Call Alert__
    - 2. __Conference Bridge__ -> __On-Call Conference__

```
  Hey there, What's the problem? Press 1 to alert an xMatters group. Press 2 to start an xMatters conference bridge.
```


4. Twilio Function __xm_group__ is initiated.
   - Prompts the user to select a target group for the notification. 
   - Configure up to 9 groups as options in the prompts.
   - This step can be disabled and you can set default recipients in xMatters instead.
   - This step is disabled by setting zero groups in xm_settings.

  ```
  What group would you like to alert. Press 1 for xyz. Press 2 for jkl. Press 3 for mno.
  What group would you like to invite to the conference. Press 1 for xyz. Press 2 for jkl. Press 3 for mno.
  ```


5. Twilio Function __xm_record__ is initiated.
   - Prompts the user to record a message over the phone.

  ```
  Record your message after the beep. Press 1 if you are happy with your recording, any other key to restart.
  ```


6. Twilio Function __xm_confirm__ is initiated.
    - Handles the case where user wants to re-record the message. 
    - Moves the script to the next function if the user is happy with the recording.

  ```
  Record your message after the beep. Press 1 if you are happy with your recording, any other key to restart.
  ```


7. Twilio Function __xm_shorten__ is initiated.
    - Sends the recording URL to Bitly where the long form URL is shortened.
    - If there is an error shortening the URL we will continue on using the long version of the URL.

  ```
  Long Recording URL:
  https://api.twilio.com/2010-04-01/Accounts/AC3e82fb9a36dc3babf7617/Recordings/RE9f98203f4201a34920fd1748c8
  
  Converted to:
  http:/bit.ly/2sjdsis2
  ```


8. Twilio Function __xm_message__ is initiated.
    - Plays some fun messages while we are waiting for the recording transcription to complete.
    - This function continuously loops checking the transcription status each time.
    - The time this step takes to complete will vary depending on the length of the recorded message.
    - When the transcription status changes to "completed" an API call to xMatters is made to initiate the new event.
    - The user is notified if the event was successfully created in xMatters or if there was a problem injecting the event.
    - Recordings / Transcriptions have a length limitation from 2 seconds up to 2 minutes.


__Wait Messages__
```
- Patients can be difficult but the rewards are great, your transcription is not quite finished yet.
- Maybe it's time for a joke... Just kidding we will be done very soon.
- You have been very patient I must say.
- I will be quiet now but im still working on it and will let you know as soon as its done.
```

__Event Sent to xMatters__
  ```
  - Sit back and relax, xMatters is taking care of business. Goodbye.
  - Oops, something went wrong. The event has not been sent. You will need to send this event directly from xMatters.
  ```


9. xMatters Inbound Integration Script.

    - This script gets the xMatters recipients out of the payload.
    - This script adds trascription text to xMatters properties "Description" and "Short Description".




# Installation


## Create an xMatters Integration User
This integration requires a user who can authenticate REST web service calls when injecting events.

This user needs to be able to work with events, but does not need to update administrative settings. While you can use the default Company Supervisor role to authenticate REST web service calls, the best method is to create a user specifically for this integration with the "REST Web Service User" role that includes the permissions and capabilities.

__Note__: If you are installing this integration into an xMatters trial instance, you don't need to create a new user. Instead, locate the "Integration User" sample user that was automatically configured with the REST Web Service User role when your instance was created and assign them a new password. You can then skip ahead to the next section.

__To create an integration user:__

1. Log in to the target xMatters system.
2. On the __Users__ tab, click the __Add New User__ icon.
3. Enter the appropriate information for your new user. 
    Example User Name __Twilio_API_User__
4. Assign the user the __REST Web Service User__ role.
5. Click __Save__.

Make a note of the user name and password that you set; you will need them when configuring other parts of this integration.

The integration user name and password will be needed when configuring the Twilio xm_settings Function: 
__xm_user__ and __xm_pass__




<br><br>
## Import and Configure the xMatters Communication Plan

The next step is to import the communication plan.

To import the communication plan:

1. In the target xMatters system, on the __Developer__ tab, click __Import Plan__.
2. Click __Browse__, and then locate the downloaded communication plan: [xMatters Initiate Event via Phone Call Communication Plan](xMattersPlan/InitiateEventviaPhoneCall.zip)
3. Click __Import Plan__.
4. Once the communication plan has been imported, click __Plan Disabled__ to enable the plan.
5. In the __Edit__ drop-down list, select __Access Permissions__.
6. Add the __Twilio_API_User__ or Make the Plan __Accessible by All__.
7. __Save Changes__.
5. In the __Edit__ drop-down list, select __Forms__.

6. For the __On-Call Resource Alert__ form, in the __Not Deployed__ drop-down list, click __Enable for Web Service__.
7. After you Enable for Web Service, the drop-down list label will change to __Web Service__.
8. In the __Web Service__ drop-down list, click __Sender Permissions__.
9. Add the __Twilio_API_User__ you created above, and then click __Save Changes__.

Repeat steps 6 to 9 for __On-Call Resource Conference__ form.

__Special Note:__ The __Twilio_API_User__ will always initiate the xMatters event for this integration. A separate setting inside the Twilio __xm_settings__ function will control whether the calling phone/person is allowed to initiate an xMatters event using this integration.  Assuming the person is calling from a phone with a caller ID matching a user in xMatters and the xm_settings configuration, an event will be created by the __Twilio_API_User__.




<br><br>
## Configure the xMatters Message

This integration will send a preconfigured message to the selected xMatters group. The _Alert_ and _Conference_ messages can be different from each other.
You can change what this message is as follows:

1. In the __Edit__ drop down list on the  _xMatters Initiate Event via Phone Call Communication Plan_ Click __Integration Builder__.
2. On the Integration Builder tab, expand the list of inbound integrations.
3. Click on either __On-Call Alert__ or __On-Call Conference__.
4. Scroll to Step 5 and click __Open Script Editor__.
5. Go to Line 65 and change the Description text.

```
trigger.properties.Description = 'THIS IS THE TEXT THAT YOU CAN CHANGE. DO NOT DELETE THE QUOTATION MARKES SURROUNDING THIS TEXT.';
```

6. Click __Save__.




<br><br>
## Get the xMatters Inbound Integration Endpoints

1. In the __Edit__ drop down list on the  _xMatters Initiate Event via Phone Call Communication Plan_ Click __Integration Builder__.
2. On the Integration Builder tab, expand the list of inbound integrations.
3. Click on either __On-Call Alert__ or __On-Call Conference__.
4. Ensure __URL Authentication__ is set.
5. In the __How to trigger the integration__ section change the Authenticating User to __Twilio_API_User__.

  You must supervise this user and it must have a Web Service User Role. If you cannot select the __Twilio_API_User__ if it because you do not supervise that user or they do not have the REST Web Service User role.

6. Copy the URL listed under the __Trigger__ section.

You will need this URL for both __On-Call Alert__ and  __On-Call Conference__.

    // The caller ID initiating this event must be a voice device listed on an xMatters user profile
    Authorized_Users = ['userid1', 'userid2', 'userid3'];
  ```   

- This is a comma separated list of xMatters userID's. Each UserID must be in quotations and separated by a comma.
- The integration will check if a user listed here has a Voice device in xMatters matching the caller ID of the person calling your Twilio number to initiate an xMatters event.
- If the caller ID that is calling your Twilio number matches a voice device of a user in xMatters listed in the Authorized_Users array, the function will proceed.
- If the caller ID that is calling your Twilio number does not match a voice device of a user in xMatters listed in the Authorized_Users array, the function will play a not authorized message and terminate the call.



<br><br>
### Group Configuration

```js   
    // Set the number of groups you would like to be able to target from this integration.
    // The number set below must match the number of groups you have in the xMatters_Groups and Speak_Groups arrays below.
    // If you set this value to 0 you must add groups / users as default recipients in the xMatters form layout.
    setting.NumberofGroups = 3;
    
    // Set the xMatters Group Names.
    // Group names must match the name of your xMatters groups exactly.
    // You can add additional Groups by adding parameters to the array below. 
    // This array must have the same number of elements as the Speak_Group array below.
    setting.xMatters_Groups = ["CAB Approval", "Cloud DevOps", "Database Infrastructure"];
     
    // Set the Twilio Group Name.
    // You can add additional punctuation, spaces, dashes, and upper case letters to group names to help the text to speech engine pronounce it better.
    // This array must have the same number of elements as the xMatters_Groups array above.
    setting.Speak_Groups = ["C.A.B. Approval", "Cloud DevOps.", "Database Infrastructure"];
```   
    
| __Integration URLS__           |                                         |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| setting.NumberofGroups         | The number of Groups listed in __setting.xMatters_Groups__                                  | 
| setting.xMatters_Groups        | Listing of Group Names, exactly how they are configured in xMatters. You will be able to send the xMatters notifications to any of the groups listed here. You can have up to 9 groups. If you want to target multiple groups at the same time we suggest creating a group with child groups and targeting the parent group from this integration. You could also use xMatters userID's to target individuals. If you dont want to use this option set it to setting.xMatters_Groups = []; Be sure to do the same for setting.Speak_Groups.|   
| setting.Speak_Groups           | Your group names may not always be easy for the Twilio text-to-speech engine to read. This option lets you type your groups names in the same order as in __settings.xMatters_Groups__ but spell them in a way that the text-to-speech engine understands. You must have the same number of groups listed here in the same order as __settings.xMatters_Groups__. Failing to do so will cause unintended behaviours.            |

<br><br>
# Troubleshooting
If you call your Twilio voice number and hear "We are sorry but your application has an error" this is a problem with one of your Twilio functions or you have not configured your Twilio Voice number to call the __xm_settings__ function when a call comes in.

Most of the issue you could encounter have to do with the configuration of the __xm_settings__ function in Twilio.
